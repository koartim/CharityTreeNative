Charity Tree is a mobile application designed to allow users to search and subscribe to the 
charitable organization of their choice. This app is built using a React Native frontend and
a Ruby on Rails Backend. Currently, CharityTree is using the Charity Navigator API, but this 
is subject to change given the cost of the API. The application is currently in a fledgling 
state, so if you would like to contribute, please contact me at koartimothy@gmail.com. 

Constructive input is welcome and appreciated!
